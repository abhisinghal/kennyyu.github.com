    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a bit late, but I had written a blog post for the project I worked on during my winter internship at Knewton. My article was published on their tech blog <a href="http://www.knewton.com/tech/blog/2012/02/graphlint-creating-a-domain-specific-language-for-graph-validation/," title="GraphLint">here</a>. I created a domain specific language to verify certain predicates on directed property graphs (e.g. all nodes of type A are connected to exactly 2 nodes of type B via edges of type E). This was a great exercise in the material I learned from the compilers course I took in the fall. Designing the language, the validation engine, and engineering the whole project was an awesome experience!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This will be my tech blog where I post my thoughts (and hopefully some code) about computer science, math, and whatever the likes. I&#8217;m using <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress">Octopress</a> for blog generation, and I&#8217;m hosting it on my Github page. Nice and simple. Yessss.</p>
