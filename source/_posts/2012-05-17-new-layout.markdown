I got a new octopress layout using Melandri's layout [here](http://melandri.net/2012/02/14/octopress-theme-customization/). I also discovered how to make cool striped backgrounds with [StripeGenerator](http://www.stripegenerator.com/), use cool new fonts from [The League of Movable Type](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/), and use cool pre-made icons with [Double-J Design](http://www.doublejdesign.co.uk/). Hopefully the layout will encourage me to actually keep up with my tech blog!
