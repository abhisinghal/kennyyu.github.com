I just installed a plugin to generate tag clouds (see the right sidebar) using
this plugin [here](https://github.com/tokkonopapa/octopress-tagcloud). I also
finally discovered how to make background images that are just noises using
this background generator [here](http://bgpatterns.com/). I like the simplicity
of these backgrounds!
