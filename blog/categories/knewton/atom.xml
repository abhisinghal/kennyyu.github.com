    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a bit late, but I had written a blog post for the project I worked on during my winter internship at Knewton. My article was published on their tech blog <a href="http://www.knewton.com/tech/blog/2012/02/graphlint-creating-a-domain-specific-language-for-graph-validation/" title="GraphLint">here</a>. I created a domain specific language to verify certain predicates on directed property graphs (e.g. all nodes of type A are connected to exactly 2 nodes of type B via edges of type E). This was a great exercise in the material I learned from the compilers course I took in the fall. Designing the language, the validation engine, and engineering the whole project was an awesome experience!</p>
