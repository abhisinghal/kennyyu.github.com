I installed LaTeX integration with Octopress using the handy hints from 
[here](http://luikore.github.com/2011/09/good-things-learned-from-octopress/).
Now I can write pretty in-line equations like $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ or
centered equations like
$$\int_{\Omega} \, d\omega = \int_{\partial \Omega} \, \omega.$$
Nice! Hopefully this will motivate me to write more math-related entries!
